# Diamond_price_ML_Project
1. Developed a machine learning project focused on diamond price prediction using various ML algorithms and techniques.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, identified patterns, and performed feature engineering to enhance model performance.
3. Implemented linear regression, decision tree, and random forest algorithms to build predictive models for diamond price estimation.
4. Evaluated model performance using industry-standard metrics, including R-squared (R2), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), achieving impressive results (mention the specific values you obtained).
5. Utilized Streamlit, a popular Python library, to create an interactive and user-friendly web application for the deployment of the diamond price prediction model.Integrated the trained ML models into the Streamlit app, allowing users to input diamond characteristics and obtain accurate price predictions in real-time.

In my diamond price analysis project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and other factors. This project aimed to assist diamond buyers, sellers, and industry professionals in making informed decisions and optimizing their pricing strategies.

The diamond market is complex and pricing can be influenced by several factors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, I trained a model using a dataset of historical diamond prices and corresponding attributes. The model learned patterns and relationships in the data, allowing it to make accurate price predictions for new diamonds.

This project can be valuable in several real-world scenarios. For diamond buyers, it helps them estimate a fair price range when considering a purchase. They can compare the predicted prices against the actual prices they encounter, enabling them to make more informed decisions and potentially negotiate better deals.

For diamond sellers and retailers, the model provides insights into the factors that drive diamond prices. They can use the predictions to set competitive prices based on the characteristics of their diamonds, ensuring they remain attractive to potential buyers while maximizing profitability.
